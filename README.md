# Minor Project
The Healthy Eating Assistant is an iOS app aimed at providing a credible, accessible, and convenient tool for tracking and managing nutrition. Addressing the increase in diet-related health concerns, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, the app empowers users to monitor their food intake with precision and ease. Using an advanced machine learning model trained on over 200 food classes, the app recognizes foods directly from images captured by the user, delivering immediate, accurate nutritional information. For packaged foods, users can scan barcodes to retrieve data from trusted sources like Nutritionix, expanding the range of foods they can log with precision.

Integrated with Apple Health through HealthKit, the app synchronizes data on calories burned during physical activities, helping users balance caloric intake with energy expenditure. This comprehensive view is especially useful for users focused on weight management or fitness goals, as they can make real-time adjustments based on a full picture of their nutrition and activity.

The appâ€™s intuitive dashboard, built using SwiftUI, presents detailed metrics, including total calories, macronutrient distribution (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), and micronutrient intake (vitamins and minerals). Users can view their data on a daily or weekly basis, allowing them to identify trends in their eating habits and make informed dietary choices. Personalized recommendations for meals are also available based on remaining calorie goals, supporting users in meeting specific dietary targets, whether they aim for weight loss, muscle gain, or balanced nutrition.

With offline functionality, users can log meals, access nutritional information, and monitor their progress without requiring an internet connection. Local data storage through Core Data or SQLite ensures continuity and reliability, allowing users to use the app seamlessly, regardless of location.

The Healthy Eating Assistant also allows users to set personal nutritional goals and track their progress, offering a customized experience that adapts to individual health and fitness needs. This feature is particularly valuable for those striving to meet specific macronutrient or caloric targets, as they can view their progress and adjust as necessary.

In summary, the Healthy Eating Assistant combines machine learning, barcode scanning, HealthKit integration, and an easy-to-use interface to create a holistic and innovative tool for tracking nutrition and supporting healthier eating habits. By delivering reliable, real-time nutritional insights, personalized recommendations, and seamless integration with health systems, this app empowers users to take control of their diets and achieve their health goals. This project exemplifies the potential of combining machine learning and mobile technology to create impactful health solutions, ultimately enhancing users' ability to make informed dietary choices and maintain a balanced lifestyle.
